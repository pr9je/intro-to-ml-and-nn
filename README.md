Loantap: Logisttic Regression


# 📊 Loan Default Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 🚀 Project Overview

LoanTap is a fintech platform that provides instant personal loans.
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict whether a borrower will:

* ✅ Fully repay the loan
* ❌ Default (Charged Off)

The goal is to **minimize financial loss (NPAs)** by identifying high-risk borrowers.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

LoanTap faces two key risks:

1. **High Risk (Critical)** → Approving a bad borrower → Loan default → Financial loss
2. **Low Risk** → Rejecting a good borrower → Missed revenue

👉 Since Risk 1 is more severe, the model prioritizes:

* **Recall (detect defaulters)** over accuracy

## 🧠 ML Problem Framing

* **Type:** Binary Classification
* **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
* **Target Variable:**

  * `Fully Paid → 0`
  * `Charged Off → 1`
